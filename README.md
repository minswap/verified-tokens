## Requirements

- Make sure your token [has a pool](https://docs.minswap.org/faq/token-launching-and-farming/1.-token-listing) with at least 100 ADA TVL
- Make sure your token has a logo added in the [Cardano Token Registry](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/cardano-token-registry) or CIP-68 metadata
- A token that has been verified but doesn't meet the requirements in the future would be unverified
